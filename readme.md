- "Main sirf backend hi nahi, tera future bhi deploy kar sakta hoon"
- "Mera mentor bhi impressed hai… tu bhi ek commit kar de zindagi mein"
- "Tab tak: git commit kar skills mein, push kar apne limits ko, aur merge kar success ko life mein "
- "Are you an interface? Because I’ve been trying to implement you all day."
- "You must be a goroutine, because you run through my mind concurrently."
- "Let's commit to each other before we merge into someone else's branch."

```shell
$ go run main.go
> You must be an API call, because I’m waiting for your response.
